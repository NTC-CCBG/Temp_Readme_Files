### Time
  * **SNTP**  
  	Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks.
    
    **systemd-timesyncd** is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an **SNTP (Simple NTP)** client. This daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with **systemd-networkd** to only operate when network connectivity is available.
        
    The modification time of this file indicates the timestamp of the last successful synchronization (or at least the **systemd build date**, in case synchronization was not possible).
    > _/var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock_
    
    **Source URL**
    * [https://github.com/systemd/systemd/tree/master/src/timesync](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/tree/master/src/timesync)
    
    **How to use**  
    * Enable NTP  
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp true  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**_ 

      If NTP is Enabled and network is Connected (Using **eth2** connect to router), we will see the item **systemd-timesyncd.service active** is **yes** and **System clock synchronized** is **yes**. Thus, system time will sync from NTP server to get current time.
    * Get NTP status  
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```
      >_Local time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC  
      >Universal time: Mon 2018-08-27 09:24:51 UTC  
      >RTC time: n/a  
      >Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)  
      >**System clock synchronized: yes**  
      >**systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes**  
      >RTC in local TZ: no_  
      
    * Disable NTP  
      ```
      timedatectl set-ntp false  
      ```
      >_timedatectl result will show **systemd-timesyncd.service active: no**_  
      
    * Using Local NTP server Configuration  
    When starting, systemd-timesyncd will read the configuration file from **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf**, which looks like as below: 
        >_[Time]  
        >\#NTP=  
        >\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_  
	
    	By default, systemd-timesyncd uses the Google Public NTP servers **time[1-4].google.com**, if no other NTP configuration is available. To add time servers or change the provided ones, **uncomment** the relevant line and list their host name or IP separated by a space. For example, we setup NB windows 10 system as NTP server with IP **192.168.1.128**  
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**  
    	>\#FallbackNTP=time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com_

    * Poleg connect to local NTP server of windows 10 system  
      Connect to NB through **eth0** EMAC interface, and set static IP **192.168.1.15**  

      ```
      ifconfig eth0 up
      ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.15
      ```  
      >_Note: Before that you need to setup your NTP server (192.168.1.128) on Windows 10 system first_  
      
      Modify **/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf** file on Poleg as we mentioned
        >_[Time]  
        >**NTP=192.168.1.128**_  
      
      Re-start NTP to make effect about our configuration change  
      ```
      systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service
      ```  
      Check status of NTP that show already synced to our local time server 
      ```
      systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service -l --no-pager
      ```  
      >_Status: "Synchronized to time server 192.168.1.128:123 (192.168.1.128)."_  
      
      Verify **Web-UI** `Server overview`->`BMC time` whether sync from NTP server as same as **timedatectl**. (Note: timedatectl time zone default is UTC, thus you will find the BMC time is UTC+8)
      ```
      timedatectl  
      ```
      >_Local time: Thu 2018-09-06 07:24:16 UTC  
      >Universal time: Thu 2018-09-06 07:24:16 UTC  
      >RTC time: n/a  
      >Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)  
      >System clock synchronized: yes

## IPMI / DCMI

### SOL IPMI

The Serial over LAN (SoL) via IPMI redirects the output of the serverâ€™s serial port to a command/terminal window on your workstation.

The user uses the ipmi tool like [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) to interact with SOL via IPMI. Here the [ipmiutil](http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/) is used as an example.

This is a patch for enabling SOL via IPMI using [phosphor-net-ipmid
](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-net-ipmid) on Nuvoton's NPCM750.

The patch integrates [phosphor-net-ipmid](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-net-ipmid) into Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution for OpenBMC.

It's verified with Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution (which is referred as Poleg here) and Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

### Message Bridging

BMC Message Bridging provides a mechanism for routing IPMI Messages between different media.

Please refer to [IPMI Website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/servers/ipmi/ipmi-home.html) for details about Message Bridging.

  * KCS to IPMB

The command "Send Message" is used to routing IPMI messages from KCS to IPMB via System Interface.

Later, the response to the bridged request is received by the BMC and routed into the Receive Message Queue and it is retrieved using a Get Message command.

The patch integrates the [kcsbridge](https://github.com/openbmc/kcsbridge), [ipmid](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid) and [ipmbbridge](https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/#/c/openbmc/ipmbbridge/+/11130/) projects.

It's verified with Nuvoton's NPCM750 solution (which is referred as Poleg here) and Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

    * In the build machine, rebuild the linux kernel for OpenBMC. As an example, enter the following command in a terminal window (build environment is configured in advance):  
      ```
      bitbake -C compile virtual/kernel
      ```

    * In the build machine, rebuild the OpenBmc image. As an example, enter the following two commands in a terminal window (build environment is configured in advance):  
      ```
      bitbake obmc-phosphor-image -c cleansstate  
      bitbake obmc-phosphor-image
      ```
    * Follow the section **Programming the images** of [Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc](https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/openbmc) to program the updated image into Poleg EVB B.

8. Modify the system interface driver in Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 to communicate with Poleg EVB A.

    * Download the kernel source code of Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 and locate the system interface driver source code.  
    * Locate the code in the function **init_ipmi_si** of ipmi_si_intf.c.
      ```
      enum ipmi_addr_src type = SI_INVALID;
      ```

    * Add the code next to the sentence "enum ipmi_addr_src type = SI_INVALID".
      ```
      return -1;
      ```

    * Rebuild the system interface driver and replace ipmi_si.ko of Ubuntu 14.04 with the one just rebuilt on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  
      > _The original ipmi_si.ko is located at /lib/modules/\`$(uname -r)\`/kernel/drivvers/char/ipmi_

    * Undo the "return -1" modification in the function **init_ipmi_si** of ipmi_si_intf.c.  
      + Rebuild the system interface driver again and leave the regenerated ipmi_si.ko in the kernel source code ipmi directory for system interface driver.

    * Reboot Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

9. Update the DSDT table in Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  

    * Study the section **How to build a custom DSDT into an initrd** of [overriding-dsdt](https://01.org/zh/linux-acpi/documentation/overriding-dsdt) and [initrd_table_override.txt](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/acpi/initrd_table_override.txt) to override DSDT in the initrd image of Ubuntu 14.04 and rebuild the Ubuntu kernel on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.
    * In the DSDT table, update the OEMRevision field in DefinitionBlock.  
    * In the DSDT table, create two objects used for accessing Poleg EVB A KCS devices via 0x4E, 0x4F.  
      ```
      Name (IDTP, 0x0CA4)  
      Name (ICDP, 0x0CA5)  
      ```

    * Locate the code section like below.  
      ```
      Device (SPMI)
      {
          ...
          Name (_STR, Unicode ("IPMI_KCS"))  
          Name (_UID, Zero)
      ```
    * Add the codes below following the sentence "Name (_UID, Zero)".  
      ```
      OperationRegion (IPST, SystemIO, ICDP, One)
      Field (IPST, ByteAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
      {
          STAS,   8
      }
      ```

    * Locate the code section like below in the same SPMI code section just mentioned.  
      ```
      Method (_STA, 0, NotSerialized)
      ...
      If (LEqual (Local0, 0xFF))
      {
      ...
      ```
    * Add the codes below inside the "If" sentence scope.
      ```
      Store (0x11, LDN)
      Store (0x1,  ACTR)
      Store (0x0C, IOAH)
      Store (0xA4, IOAL)
      Store (0x0C, IOH2)
      Store (0xA5, IOL2)
      ```

    * Rebuild the modified DSDT table and regenerate the initrd image of Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  
    * Reboot Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 to load the overriden DSDT.

10. (Optional)Create shell scripts in Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

    * The scripts here are just for convenience and for reference.  
    * Download and build [ioport-1.2.tar.gz](https://people.redhat.com/rjones/ioport/files/ioport-1.2.tar.gz).  
      + Locate the generated **outb** executive.
    * Create a script named "kcs_switch.sh" for example to configure the access to the kcs device of Poleg EVB A from Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  
    * The user needs to modify the path to the outb executive in the script (kcs_switch.sh) below.  
      ```
      #!/bin/sh
      outb 0x4e 0x07
      outb 0x4f 0x11

      outb 0x4e 0x30
      outb 0x4f 0x1

      outb 0x4e 0x60
      outb 0x4f 0x0C
      outb 0x4e 0x61
      outb 0x4f 0xA4
      outb 0x4e 0x62
      outb 0x4f 0x0C
      outb 0x4e 0x63
      outb 0x4f 0xA5
      ```

     * Create a script name "insert_ipmi_mod.sh" for example to use the regenerated KCS driver in the kernel source code ipmi directory metioned in step-8.  
     * The user needs to modify the path to the KCS driver in insert_ipmi_mod.sh below.  

       ```
       #!/bin/sh
       sudo insmod ./ipmi_devintf.ko
       sudo insmod ./ipmi_si.ko
       ```

    * Make sure that two scripts above are executable.

11. Install the ipmiutil in Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.

    * Download, extract, build and install [ipmiutil-3.1.2.tar.gz](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipmiutil/files/ipmiutil-3.1.2.tar.gz).  
    * Open a terminal window and navigate to the extracted folder of ipmiutil-3.1.2.tar.gz.  
    * Input the following command in the terminal window.
      ```
      sudo ./scripts/ipmi_if.sh
      ```
    * This generates /var/lib/ipmiutil/ipmi_if.txt.  
    * Edit /var/lib/ipmiutil/ipmi_if.txt with the root privilege. 
    * The value for "Base Address:" is **0x0000000000000CA2 (I/O)** and modify it to **0x0000000000000CA4 (I/O)**.

12. Test message bridging.

    * Power up or reboot Poleg EVB A and Poleg EVB B. Make sure that login screens of Poleg EVBs are displayed on the terminal window (e.g. Tera Term) on your workstation.
    * Power up or reboot Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0 and login into Ubuntu 14.04 as a normal user.  
      + Open a terminal window and execute **kcs_switch.sh** and **insert_ipmi_mod.sh** created in step-10 with the root privilege.
      + If the scripts are not created, input the contents of **kcs_switch.sh** and **insert_ipmi_mod.sh** except the #!/bin/sh line manually.
    * Enter the following command in a terminal window as a normal user of Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  
      ```
      sudo ipmiutil cmd 18 34 02 10 18 d8 20 0e 01 d1 -x -s -j -F kcs
      ```
      > _The example command in the data field of "Send Message" command is "Get Device ID"._

    * Enter the following command in a terminal window as a normal user of Ubuntu 14.04 on Supermicro MBD-X9SCL-F-0.  
      ```
      sudo ipmiutil cmd 18 33 -x -s -j -F kcs
      ```
      > _The response to "Get Device ID" command might be "respData[len=26]: 1c 33 00 02 1e c2 58 00 01 00 00 00 02 03 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 a0"._
